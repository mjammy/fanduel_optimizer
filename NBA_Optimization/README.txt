Can scrape things properly, but this website doesn't show historical NBA stuff unless you pay...

I wonder if it's because NBA is more predictable compared to NFL (which they give you access to everything)

It can't be that expensive but I'll pay for it with the $$$ I win from the NFL one if it works
